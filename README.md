### What is it?
The Gerbil Backdoor Remote Control Service is a lightweight, fast-deploy tool for managing a large scale attack using the Gerbil automated hacker. It provides a way to issue commands and redirect processing power to effectively take out high priority targets in complex networks. It offers a cache to help the Gerbil AI engine have a larger repository in which to draw training data from, making smarter decisions. It also offers an alternative mode to modify the command chain to create a "stabbing ring", in which it becomes near-impossible to trace the origin of the Gerbil-powered attack.

### Isn't that dangerous?
Yep, absolutely, which is why you should read our disclaimer below and don't try it on a computer you use every day or that's not yours.

### No, dangerous, like SkyNet.
Although Gerbil and many of the AI systems found in Hollywood movies possess similar traits, Gerbil does not posess the capabilities to do such attacks. In order for a Gerbil attack to start, the Gerbil executable must be manually planted behind a firewall. Gerbil has hard-coded rules that dictate what computers it can and can't attack. Part of that rule is that it cannot attack computers outside of it's subnet, making it impossible for an infection to spread outside of the initial attack network.

### What does it run on?
The Gerbil BRCS tool runs on any Cedar-stack based Heroku Dyno. All it involves is creation of a Dyno and a `git push`. Configuration can be done in less than two clicks with a forest manager (**not available yet**).

### Obvious Legal Disclaimer
Both Gerbil and the BRCS tool have the capability to deal severe damage to information systems including destruction of hardware and loss of critical data. NETponents, @ARMmaster17, or any author of any Gerbil-related project cannot be held liable by actions taken by this system. It is your responsibility to secure your own lab network before testing Gerbil.
