#### What is it?
The Gerbil Backdoor Remote Control Service is a lightweight, fast-deploy tool for managing a large scale attack using the Gerbil automated hacker. It provides a way to issue commands and redirect processing power to effectively take out high priority targets in complex networks.

### What does it run on?
The Gerbil BRCS tool runs on any Cedar-stack based Heroku Dyno. All it involves is creation of a Dyno and a `git push`. Configuration can be done in less than two clicks with a forest manager (**not available yet**).
