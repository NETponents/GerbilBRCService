### What does it run on?
The Gerbil BRCS tool runs on any Cedar-stack based Heroku Dyno. All it involves is creation of a Dyno and a `git push`. Configuration can be done in less than two clicks with a forest manager (**not available yet**).

### Obvious Legal Disclaimer
Both Gerbil and the BRCS tool have the capability to deal severe damage to information systems including destruction of hardware and loss of critical data. NETponents, @ARMmaster17, or any author of any Gerbil-related project cannot be held liable by actions taken by this system. It is your responsibility to secure your own lab network before testing Gerbil.
